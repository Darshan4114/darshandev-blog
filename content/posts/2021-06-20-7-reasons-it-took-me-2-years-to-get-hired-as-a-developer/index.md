excerpt: Nowadays you hear stories about how people learn to code and get hired as developers all in 2-3 months. I couldn't do it. So here are a few mistakes you shouldn't repeat

## Why would someone want to be a web developer?

My answer at that time was money! and me not being particularly bad with computers. I had no idea how to make money, but I seriously needed money. I couldn't ask my parents for money every now and then, it would be really awkward.
I could see the world is run by money and I couldn't do well if I make less of it, or worse none of it.
So I started...

## Why did it take so long?

Nowadays you hear a lot of amazing stories about how someone became a web developer in 2 months and landed a client and all. I just couldn't do that.
I had in fact given up on programming a year ago, before starting again.
You can sure tell it was no kids business to start programming the web and be good at getting clients just in 2-4 months. Now if I were to look back and say what would I do differently if given the chance to start again.

1. Just learn the frontend and start applying to jobs. Don't mess with the backend in the beginning its too vast believe me.
2. Get good at your game. Make at least one webisite with html-css every 2 days or so. You will be real good at the end of the month with 15 websites if you keep at it.
3. Learn a designing software, learn Figma, AdobeXD, Photoshop, anything that helps you conceptualize the idea of how the website is gonna look on a monitor, tablet and a phone. Don't even think about touching the HTML without having a clear idea of your end goal. Don't say you can imagine it. You can't.
   > Many courses from udemy and youtube ignore this fact and cause a very hard time for the learner
4. Once you have enough experience, i.e. 3-4 great sites under your belt. You can start applying to jobs, freelance work( don't go to freelance sites! ). Apply to a lot of them, its a numbers game.

5. And yes I mean don't go to upwork and freelancer rightaway. It is extremely difficult to get hold of any clients on those platforms if you don't have reviews.

6. Don't waste time on bad clients
   You will meet people who will pay you in effing EXPOSURE!!!
   Fck them! I mean it. They are the worst people for your starting place, even though they can pay you something, they won't. Many people advice to work for free, maybe it works maybe it don't.
   You don't even know if you are going to get paid to do this! And these people reimpose the doubt. Instead say no, and move on to other people who might wanna pay you. And if they are really interested in your services they will get back to you.

7. Make a portfolio for your projects
   You need to have a collection of your projects up on a display somewhere. Buy a domain and make a awesome looking site and have your projects up there. Whenever a prospect asks you for a look at your projects you can show them the site.

I hope these points help you get to work sooner, especially in this difficult time. Stay home! Stay Safe!
Cheers :)
